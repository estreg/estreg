Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GiHub profile.

# About Me
I originally come from a background in theoretical philosophy, where I explored questions about mind or consciousness and cognition 🧠.
These days, I’m diving into similarly complex — yet totally different — systems through code. Not with arguments and papers anymore, but with programming languages, APIs, and databases — and not in MS Word, but in VS Code 💻 and with the CLI ⚙️.

I'm currently learning through Boot.dev and working my way toward a career in backend development for about half a year now. 🚀
