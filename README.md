# Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GiHub profile.

## About Me
I originally come from a background in theoretical philosophy, where I explored questions about mind / consciousness and cognition 🧠.
These days, I’m diving into similarly complex — yet totally different — systems through code. Not with arguments and papers anymore, but with programming languages, APIs, and databases — and not in MS Word, but in VS Code 💻 and with the CLI ⚙️.

I'm currently learning through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) for about half a year now and working my way toward a career in backend development 🚀.
On my [profile](https://www.boot.dev/u/estreg) you can check out which courses I’ve already completed and which achievements I’ve unlocked along the way.

  Btw, I’m officially an Archmage 🧙‍♂️.

## Technologies
~~I use Arch *btw*,~~ I use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), and WSL2 Ubuntu on my main rig.

So far in my (still short) journey, I’ve mainly worked with
- Go 🐹 and
- Python 🐍,
- but I’ve also taken some courses in JavaScript 🌐 and TypeScript 📘.

For more tools I’m learning to work with, feel free to check out my repositories!

## Projects
At the moment, I’m working on a [CLI AI agent tool](https://github.com/estreg/ai-agent-hegstreg) — partly to brush up on my Python skills, but also to get a better grasp of how these smart little gadgets 🤖 actually work.
I’m also sketching out ideas for a CLI text adventure in the spirit of *[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork#:~:text=Historians%20have%20argued%20that%20Zork,online%20role%2Dplaying%20game%20genre.)*, but most of my time still goes into Boot.dev courses 📚.

If you’ve got cool ideas for a trainee or feel like building something together, feel free to reach out! 🤝

## Contact

If you want to get in touch, *LinkedIn* is the best way to reach me for now 💬.

## What I do when I’m not debugging
- Play the bass guitar in a extreme metal band called *Marcation* [Bandcamp](https://marcation.bandcamp.com/album/madness)/[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marcation_official/)
- *EDH*: where I go to find peace, power, and occasionally infinite combos. And *Deckbuilding* in EDH is how I realign my mental mana pool.
- I recharge my social battery by hitting the *gym* 🏋️‍♂️, exploring the *outdoors* 🥾, and diving into *books* 📚 that are too heavy to carry on hikes.
- When it comes to escaping reality, I love diving into *pen & paper* adventures — the darker and more eldritch, the better 🐙.
- My gaming career is currently on pause ⏸️ so I can focus fully on developing — but some games still hold a special place in my heart:
  - Dark Souls 1, 3 und Elden Ring
  - World of Warcraft Retail
  - Baldurs Gate III
  - Disco Elysium
  - Bioshock
  - Final Fantasy 10

Thank you for visiting! And maybe we can share some code in the future 🧪
