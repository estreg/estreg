# Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GiHub profile.

## About Me
<p align="center">
I originally come from a background in theoretical philosophy, where I explored questions about mind / consciousness and cognition 🧠.
These days, I’m diving into similarly complex — yet totally different — systems through code. Not with arguments and papers anymore, but with programming languages, APIs, and databases — and not in MS Word, but in VS Code 💻 and with the CLI ⚙️.
</p>
<p align="center">
I'm currently learning through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) for about half a year now and working my way toward a career in backend development 🚀.
On my [profile](https://www.boot.dev/u/estreg) you can check out which courses I’ve already completed and which achievements I’ve unlocked along the way.

<p align="center">
  Btw, I’m officially an Archmage 🧙‍♂️.

## Projects
At the moment, I’m working on a [CLI AI agent tool](https://github.com/estreg/ai-agent-hegstreg) — partly to brush up on my Python skills, but also to get a better grasp of how these smart little gadgets 🤖 actually work.
