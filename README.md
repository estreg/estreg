Hi there 👋 and welcome to my GiHub profile.

# About Me
I originally come from a background in theoretical philosophy, where I explored questions about mind or consciousness and cognition 🧠.
These days, I’m diving into similarly complex — yet totally different — systems through code. Not with arguments and papers anymore, but with programming languages, APIs, and databases — and not in MS Word, but in VS Code 💻 and with the CLI ⚙️.

I'm currently learning through [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) for about half a year now and working my way toward a career in backend development 🚀.
On my [profile](https://www.boot.dev/u/estreg) you can check out which courses I’ve already completed and which achievements I’ve unlocked along the way.

Btw, I’m officially an Archmage 🧙‍♂️.

# Technologies
I don’t use Arch btw, but I use [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), and WSL2 Ubuntu on my main rig.
